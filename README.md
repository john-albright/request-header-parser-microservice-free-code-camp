# Free Code Camp: Back End Development and APIs Project 2/5
## [Request Header Parser Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/request-header-parser-microservice)

This project is the second of five projects to be completed for FreeCodeCamp's fifth of six JavaScript certificate: [Back End Development and APIs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis). A live demo of the project can be found on [Replit](https://replit.com/@john-albright/request-header-parser-microservice-free-code-camp). The API retrieves information about the computer and browser being used by the user. A JSON object is returned at the subdirectory /whoami/ with the keys ipaddress, language, and software. It is a simple API that only has one subdirectory that cannot be customized in any way.
